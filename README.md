# Sudoku-Solver
This is a Sudoku Solver application created using Pygame.

#Instructions:
Opening the application will launch a sudoku game.
Press SPACE to auto-complete the sudoku.
To complete the sudoku manually, click the respective boxes in the grid and enter numbers using keyboard.
(NOTE: The number will only be entered if it is meant to be there i.e. matches the solution grid).
To see invalid inputs, enter any number while holding the mouse button. The number appears to be red if the input is incorrect and black if it is correct. Releasing the mouse button will remove the number if it is incorrect.

#Development Plans:
To create a menu which allows the user to enter the sudoku board and then print the solution.
To create a button to generate a random sudoku game everytime you enter the application.
